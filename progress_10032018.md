### Course
I would like to take all course in first year, so I can focus on research on
second and third year. 
Rationale to take the courses:
- Course related to my research
- Course related to Acoustics (Speech and Hearing)
- Course related to Computing
- Another proposal is to obtain study program:
Education Program for Leaders in Data Analytics. 

However, some course schedule are 
crash with other courses.
List Course that I want to take:

Term 1-1:
- I225E Statistical Signal Processing (H. Tanaka, 2 Int)
- I119 Statistics for Data Analytics (Akagi,2 Opt)
- I112 Basics of Computer Systems (Yoshitaka, 2 Opt)
- S503 Innovation Theory and Methodology for Total Capability Development (1 int)

Term 1-2:
- I416 Parallel Processing (Inoguchi, 2 Adv)
- K236EJ Basis of Data Analytics (Ho Bao・Dam・Ide, 2 Int) OR Natural Language Processing I (Nguyen, 2 Int)
- I411 Pattern Analysis and Recognition (Kotani, 2 Adv) 

Term 1-3:
- I237E Formal Languages and Automata (Ogawa, 2 Imd)
- I214E System Optimization (M.Kaneko・Hiraishi, 2 Imd)
- K417EJ Data Analytics (Ho Bao・Dam, 2 Opt)

Term 1-4:
- K619E Advanced Data Analytics (Ho Bao・Dam, 2 Opt) OR I645E Human Perceptual Systems and its Models (Unoki, 2 Adv)
- I213E Discrete Signal Processing (Chong, 2 Imd)

Total obtained credit:
- Intermidiete courses: 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11 + 2 (internship) = 13 (13)
- Advanced courses: 2 + 2 = 4 + 6 (dissertation) = 10 (12)

### Research
The initial step of my proposed research is (accouding to my opinion) are database and method.
Here is my proposal.
