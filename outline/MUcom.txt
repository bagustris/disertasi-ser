Dear Unoki-sensei,

Thanks for your feedback on terminology. I see this problem is caused by the
same terminology used in different area, i.e., phisiology vs information
science/processing. In physiology, the defition of multimodality is only limited
to (five) sensory modalities, but in information science/processing the
definition of multimodality is the presence of more than one information's
channel [1]. Hence, the definition of "modality" here is closer to represent
channel (in brain processing) rather than sensory organs. 

I also added new chapter 3 "Research Methodology" to address 
why and how should I tackle the problems in my research.
Thank you for finding this gap.

I attached the revised version of my outline.
