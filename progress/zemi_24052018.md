Define problem and/or challange  
Problem: Need to be solved  
Challange: Need to be improved  

Case:  
Emotion can be recognized in many way, for example 
speech and words. By listening what is some one said, 
we can determine his/her emotion, espechially from his/her 
speech intensity, loudness and other. 
For challlange, we can improve the recognition rate by 
adding text feature combined with speech feature.

For such a problem, imagine someone talk loudly. 
He is not angry, but happy. If we can't hear clearly, 
we will assume he is angry. It is similar when someone 
crying. We will assume he/she is sad, although, he/she 
actually happy.


Akagi-sensei: 
What part you focus on your research?


What part you want to improve...?

Reda:  
Don't use semantic primitive. It takes a long time
For acted speech, the text feature will be independant.
not related to Emotion. Because, usually acted speech 
is spoken not only for specific emotion, but for some 
emotions. 


Unoki-sensei:
Only combine text and feature...?
How about predicting emotion inside system..?



Production vs perceived
