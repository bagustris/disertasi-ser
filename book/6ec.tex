\chapter{Fusing Acoustic and Linguistic Information at Decision Level}
This paper evaluates the error 
correcting capabilities of concatenated codes 
employing MDS codes as outer codes and
time-varying randomly selected inner codes,
used on discrete memoryless channels with modified MMI
decoding. It is proved that 
Gallager's random coding error exponent
can be obtained for all rates by such codes.
