% thank to prof akagi
The author wishes to express his sincere gratitude to his principal supervisor,
Professor Masato Akagi of Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,
for his constant encouragement and kind guidance during this dissertation work.
Prof. Akagi not only guides the author on the research direction but also kept
the timeline of the research stay on the track. Prof. Akagi is a role model of
supervisor for granting "license" for prospectus researcher, a PhD student. 

% thank to prof Unoki
The author also wishes to express his thanks to Professor Unoki, the
co-supervisor of this dissertation. Without his critical questions, some 
part of this doctoral study will not exist. I owe the idea of multitask
learning and silence pause features calculations to Prof. Unoki.

% thank to prof Shirai
The author is grateful to Professor Kiyoaki Shiari for his helpful
suggestions and discussions during minor research. With a background of acoustic
information science, I have no sufficient knowledge of linguistic information 
processing until I conduct my minor research in his lab. His patience and
kindness accelerate my understanding on the use of linguistic information 
for dimensional speech emotion recognition.

% thank to AIS member
The kind, friendly, and warm atmosphere at Acoustic Information Science-Lab
(Akagi and Unoki Lab) was the best place for conducting research and study.
Surrounded by forests and natural landscape, there is no better place for my PhD
study except in JAIST. I would like thank to all AIS members for their kindness
support during my PhD studies.

% thank to MEXT
Funding is one of crucial factor when conducting research. I would like to 
thank to Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) 
for granting me a scholarship for my research and doctoral studies.

I would like to thank to my family and friends. This thesis is
dedicated for them: my parents, my sisters, my wife and my son. 

Finally, life is short, let's do the best.
